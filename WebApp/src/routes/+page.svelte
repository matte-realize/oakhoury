		We are OAKhoury Trees, an organization built by students and run by volunteers, all for the city
		of Oakland. We operate independently with the goal of planting trees across all neighborhoods in
		our beautiful city.

	<p class="mx-auto mb-8 max-w-2xl text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
		We were founded by three students of Northeastern University Oakland, supervised by our amazing
		databases professor. The four of us sat and pondered the question "Why doesn't Oakland have more
		trees?" We then got to work.
